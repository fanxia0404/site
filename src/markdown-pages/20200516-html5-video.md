# HTML 5 Video

## Quick Start

[The Video Embed element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) on MDN explains how to use `<video>` HTML element in great detail.

The following code snippet will embed a vieo which will autoplay and loop on both desktop and mobile browsers.

### HTML

```html
<video playsinline autoplay muted loop>
    <source src="/path-to-video" type="video/mp4" />
    <div>
        <h3>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.</h3>
        <p>Here is a <a href={/path-to-video}>link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </div>
</video>
```

### React

```jsx
<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop>
    <source src={videoPath} type="video/mp4" />
    <div>
        <h3>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.</h3>
        <p>Here is a <a href={videoPath}>link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </div>
</video>
```

Note that `playsInline` and `autoPlay` are camel case, although the corresponding HTML attributes do not have dash between them.

## Autoplay on Mobile Browsers

In order to autoplay videos on mobile browsers, All of the following attributes need to be specified:

- `autoPlay`
- `muted`
- `playsinline`

## Video Processing Using `ffmpeg`

When preparing video resources for my site, I realized `ffmpeg` is super handy.

### Convert Video Format

The following code snippet converts the video from `.mov` format to `.mp4` format.

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec copy -acodec copy output.mp4
```

### Compress MP4 Video on Mac

The following code snippet compresses the video, to increase performance

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 compressed.mp4
```
